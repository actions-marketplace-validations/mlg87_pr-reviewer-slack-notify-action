# PR Reviewer Slack Notify Action

This action will post a message to a channel in Slack @ing the requested reviewers when a PR is opened. This is very easy to set up, but will require you to create an app in Slack as well where you can create incoming webhooks for your desired destinations.

## Setting up the Slack app

[Create a Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps) with `Bots` and `Permissions` functionality. It is worth noting that you will need administrator privileges for this, so hit up your IT team in advance. Once the app is created install it to your workspace and invite the bot to the channel you would messages posted to.

You will need to make sure that the bot has the correct minimum required scopes:

- `chat:write`
- `reactions:read`
- `reactions:write`

##### NOTE: previous versions of this action relied on `Incoming Webhooks`. In order to post to the message thread and have the bot update reactions, it is now required to provide this permissions

## Adding the action to your project

In your `./github/workflows` directory, add a `slackNotify.yml` (or whatever the hell you want to call it) file. Add the following as contents:

```yml
name: PR Review Slack Notify
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, ready_for_review]
  pull_request_review:
    types: [submitted]
  push:

jobs:
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: PR Review Slack Notify
    steps:
      - name: Send slack notifications to requested reviewers
        id: pr-slack-notify
        uses: mlg87/pr-reviewer-slack-notify-action@v4.0.8
        with:
          base-branch: "staging"
          bot-token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN }}
          channel-id: "[GET_THIS_FROM_SLACK]"
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
          slack-users: '[{ "github_username": "mlg87", "slack_id": "[GET_ME_FROM_YOUR_SLACK_WORKSPACE]" }]'
```

##### NOTE: It is recommended to store the webhook in GitHub Secrets

## How to use

I intended to make this work for the `pull_request.review_requested` event. However, keying off that event will end up spamming your Slack channel you are posting to. This happens because it will include all added reviewers at the time it runs, so if you add `user1` as a reviewer and then search for and add `user2`, it will run the action twice with arrays of `requested_reviewers: [user1, user2]`, and since there is no way to keep track of who has already been notified, this can send _n_ messages.

**Solution**: only run this action on `pull_request.opened` and `pull_request.ready_for_review`. Somewhat annoying that this requires devs to use a specific flow in order for the messages to go out, but it's the best idea I've got right now. Just make sure reviewers are assigned prior to opening the PR or converting a draft to ready.

An example of a PR lifecyle and how the bot works:

1. User gets ready to open PR and assigns reviewers prior to opening the PR.
1. User opens PR.
1. Action runs, and posts a message in the provided Slack channel mentioning the requested reviewers in a message that includes a link to the PR, the PR title and the PR body (description/first comment) if it is provided.
1. One of the reviewers requests changes to the PR, so the action adds the stop sign reaction to the original thread and mentions the PR author in a message in the thread that changes have been requested. The body (main comment associated with the review) is included in the message.
1. PR owner pushes up code changes, so action removes reactions from the thread and notifies the requested reviewers that there is new code and they should go check it out.
1. Someone appoves! Action updates the reactions accordingly and notifies the PR owner.
1. The code gets merged into the `base-branch`, so action updates the thread and reactions.

K, bye.
